# Scripts for deploying me

## Setup
Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/elyamad/marvel-react.git
cd marvel-react
npm install
npm start
Browse to http://localhost:8080
```
## Nice to know
If you have a problem saying
``` 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource
```
you it must restart your navigator with the option 
```
--disable-web-security
```

In my case, i do 
```
chromium-browser --disable-web-security
```
